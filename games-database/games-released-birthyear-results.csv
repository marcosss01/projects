12351,70241,The Adventures of MicroMan,"MicroMan is the victim of a top-secret experiment that went terribly wrong.

Wearing a special weapons suit, Bob Jones voluntarily stepped into the Molecular Miniaturizer created by Dr. Schnapps. The doctor turned on the power and the miniaturization process began.

After a few moments of blinding white light, Bob Jones was reduced to the size of a few microns.

The experiment seemed to be a success but the Molecular Miniaturizer suddenly started smoking and a few seconds later, exploded, killing all those in the lab, including Dr. Schnapps.

Bob Jones, now known as MicroMan, was never found after the explosion.

However, since the Molecular Miniaturizer and its creator had both been destroyed, it didn't really matter – there was no hope to return MicroMan (formerly Bob Jones) to his original size.

MicroMan now finds himself in a strange and hostile world where he is one of the smallest inhabitants. Now, his mission is personal: to explore and stay alive.",1993-04-01 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

14058,42446,Super Nova,"The history of human fighting has continued since human ancestors grabbed the bones of beasts.

""Solar Defense War""

A long, long time has passed since the last battle with the enemy ""Belsar"", and the descendants of the planet Darius continued to thrive in permanent peace. They pioneered and established hundreds of planet states, established the Galactic Federation centered on the planet Olga, and were committed to mutual security cooperation and non-aggression between states. Even after thousands of years, the power that never fades, the growing machine “Silver Hawk”, a formal fighter of the Galactic Commonwealth Army, was deployed as a standard fighter in all federal member states and was in charge of security.

The wise men of the past had ordered numerous enhancements, improvements and mass production, in preparation for the imminent return of the invaders. Everyone has long since received the legendary names of two former heroes, Proco and Tiat, as legends. Young generations who wish to fight in such an era are considered foolish.

However, the history repeats itself. Now again, new war fronts are about to be opened in the corners of the galaxy. The huge and unknown enemy is different from the former “Belsar”.

17431,18577,Battletoads In Battlemaniacs,"The story begins with the Battletoads visiting the Gyachung-La fortress in northern Tibet. Professor T. Bird has invited them there to witness the Psicone Corporation's first demonstration of their new virtual reality game system, T.R.I.P.S (Total Reality Integrated Playing System). While showing off the system's artificial world (entitled ""The Gamescape""), a pig of the apocalypse leaps out of the screen and kidnaps Michiko Tashoku (daughter of Psicone Corporation's CEO, Yuriko Tashoku). Zitz attempts to rescue her, but gets knocked out by the pig and captured as well. The pig escapes back into the Gamescape and Silas Volkmire appears on the screen, announcing his plans to turn the real world into his own Gamescape, and that Michiko and Zitz are being held captive under the evil Dark Queen. With nothing left to lose, Rash and Pimple enter the Gamescape to rescue their friends and stop Volkmire and the Dark Queen from fulfilling their plans.
Along the way, they fight Rocky, a giant stone pig, and race against Scuzz, a rat that challenges them all throughout the final level. The Battletoads finally reach the Dark Queen in her tower and defeat her, but she manages to escape again. Bird picks up Volkmire on his scanners and finds out that he is trying to escape using a teleporter, so the Battletoads leave the Gamescape and hop into the Battlecopter to chase after him.
Depending on the player's actions during this final gameplay segment, there are two possible endings that may occur. If the player is unable to shoot three missiles at Volkmire's teleporter, he gets away, and the Battletoads feel dejected knowing that Volkmire is free and the Dark Queen wants revenge. If the player successfully shoots three missiles at Volkmire's teleporter, the ship crashes in the Himalayas and is recovered, but Volkmire is nowhere to be found. Similarly to the first ending, it is alluded to that Volkmire and the Dark Queen will want revenge.",1993-06-06 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,59.9757,19

While Earth seemed peaceful for a while, cases of sudden disappearances of federal troops began to occur frequently, and Londo Bell was ordered to investigate. Originally it was believed that DC remnants were responsible, but it is later discovered that the true reason behind the disappearances was a threat from outer space, an alien invasion like Bian Zoldark feared that could occur.

After executing a space fold that sent it and part of South Ataria Island to the edge of the Solar System, the space fortress Macross is on its way back to Earth. During a small skirmish with Zentradi forces, young pilot Hikaru Ichijyo rescues idol singer Lynn Minmay and their relationship develops as they're stranded somewhere within the ship. But shortly after returning to Macross City, Minmay is captured by the Zentradi, and Hikaru and female officer Misa Hayase end up back on Earth - only to view the aftermath of the destruction of their civilization. Only a song discovered eons ago - along with Minmay's voice - can determine the outcome of the war.",1993-11-29 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

53019,5519,Cannon Fodder,"Cannon Fodder is a military-themed action game with strategy and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad of up to five soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset, the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles such as Jeeps, tanks and helicopters as well as missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must utilise secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets. Ammunition for these weapons is limited and the player must find supply crates to replenish his troops. Wasting these weapons can potentially result in the player not having enough to fulfil the mission objectives. The player can opt to shoot crates - destroying enemy troops and buildings in the ensuing explosion - at less risk to his soldiers than retrieving them, but again at a greater risk of depleting ammunition.

The player proceeds through 23 missions divided into several levels each, making 72 levels in all. There are various settings including jungle, snow and desert, some with unique terrain features and vehicles such as igloos and snowmobiles. The player must also contend with rivers (crossing which soldiers are slowed and cannot fire) and quicksand as well as mines and other booby traps. In addition to shooting action, the game features strategy elements and employs a point-and-click control system more common to strategy than action games.[9] As the player's troops are heavily outnumbered and easily killed, he must use caution, as well as careful planning and positioning. To this end, he can split the squad into smaller units to take up separate positions or risk fewer soldiers when moving into dangerous areas.",1993-12-01 00:00:00.000,13,NULL,NULL,NULL,83.3135,41

Although not related to the actual Castlevania storyline, Galamoth, the villain of the Boku Dracula-kun series, is responsible for starting the events seen in Castlevania Judgment; this somehow created a connection.

70122,38747,Pathways into Darkness,"Sixty-four million years ago, a large extra-terrestrial object struck the Earth in what would later be called the Yucatan Peninsula, in southeastern Mexico. The dust and rock thrown up by the resulting explosion caused enormous climactic changes in the ensuing years, and many of the Earth's species became extinct during the long winter that followed.

The object itself was buried thousands of feet below ground, its nearly two kilometer length remarkably intact. It remained there, motionless, for thousands of years before it finally began to stir- and to dream. It was a member of a race whose history began when the Milky Way was still a formless collection of dust and gas- a powerful race of immortals which had quickly grown bored of their tiny universe and nearly exterminated themselves in war.

This particular being, whose name no human throat will ever learn to pronounce, was part of the cataclysmic battle that formed Magellanic Clouds, billions of years ago. It died there, or it came as close to dying as these things can, and drifted aimlessly for millions of light years before striking the Earth.

The heat of impact liquefied the rock around it, which later cooled and encased the dead god's huge body far below ground. As it began to dream, it wrought unintentional changes in its environment. Locked deep beneath the Earth, strange and unbelievable things faded in and out of reality. Vast caverns and landscapes bubbled to life within the rock, populated by horrible manifestations of the dead god's dream.

Only during the last few centuries has the god begun to effect changes on the surface of the Earth. Grotesque creatures have been sighted deep in the trackless forest of the Yucatan, and strange rumors of an ancient pyramid- which is neither Aztec nor Mayan- in the same area have been circulating in the archaeological community since the early 1930's.

After an event called the Great Collapse, much of the once-thriving planet Motavia has been reduced to desert, and life has become progressively more difficult for the planet's inhabitants. To make matters worse, there has been a marked increase in the numbers of the ""biomonsters,"" a catch-all term for the strange and violent aberrations of Motavia's flora and fauna.

Keeping these creatures under control is the job of ""hunters"". During an investigation into such an outbreak, Chaz Ashley, a young hunter, learns of the relationship between the biomonster problem and the planet's ecological crisis. The planet is in the process of returning to its original desert state as the climate and biosphere-controlling devices installed over a thousand years previous begin to fail. The reasons behind the malfunctions are clarified as the plot unfolds, relating directly to the events of Phantasy Star II.

Chaz and his allies connect the world's troubles to a cult leader called Zio, ""The Black Magician,"" whose aims appear to be total annihilation, not only of Motavia, but of the whole Algol solar system. The heroes stop Zio in order to restore the computer systems maintaining Motavia. However, it soon becomes clear that Zio is merely the vanguard to a much larger enemy, long buried in the past. The secrets of the Algol star system are revealed as Chaz and company discover both the nature of the threat to their worlds as well as the safeguards placed in a time long forgotten.",1993-12-17 00:00:00.000,9,NULL,NULL,NULL,89.9515,33

He sails across from Akrillic to the nearby Cotton Island to find it from there. After rising up a couple of mistaken flags as it starting to irritates him, Plok encounters the two giants creatures who are responsible for placing them, the Bobbins Brothers. Plok aforementioned to them about his grandfather who gave him a warning about the Bobbins and decided to fight the two for the large flag. 
 
After vanquishing the Bobbins Brothers and getting his big square flag back, Plok sails his way back to Akrillic until the next day, out of the blue, he find that the island has been infested and over taken by fleas with various of eggs, an annoying medium-sized two-legged blue insects that frequently hops around. He quickly learned that the theft of his large flag was simply a decoy to lure him away from Akrillic and leave him unguarded due to his obsessions with flags. Plok must travel throughout Akrillic, getting rid of every single flea on the surface in order to reclaim his island at peace. Partway through the game, at the outside of his home, Plok places the big square flag back right where it belongs and then takes a break as he sits on a foot of the statue of his grandfather Grandpappy Plok, hoping there is a useful item that will help him to deal with the fleas. He took a nap and having an odd dream of his grandfather's search for a amulet 50 years ago. 
 
Sailing across from his home and onward to Legacy Island, Grandpappy shares the same experience of what his grandson has to in the present: traveling through bizarre obstacles, discovering wrong artifacts like a vase, and dealing with two same Bobbin Brothers, but that with their third brother Irving. After him defeating the Bobbin Brothers, Grandpappy finally dug up an amulet and sail back to his home at Akrillic victoriously. Back to the present day, Plok woke up from a dream and discovers that the amulet is located at the bottom of the statue. Plok's mission on getting his island back continues with an ability where he can turn himself into a saw. 
 
Plok then heads into various of locations around the island while facing other creatures who also have an intention to take over the island as well: the magicians Penkinos, a large spider Womack, and a huge humanoid rock creature Rockyfella. After confronting them as he clearing out all the fleas from Akrillic and rising the flags, Plok descends into Brendammi Bog where the source of all the bizarre (yet aggressive) fleas is located, the Fleapit. There, Plok notices various presents waiting for him as he rides on various vehicles with different kinds of arsenals.

88988,8995,NBA Jam,"NBA Jam, which featured 2-on-2 basketball, is one of the first real playable basketball arcade games, and is also one of the first sports games to feature NBA-licensed teams and players, and their real digitized likenesses.
A key feature of NBA Jam is the exaggerated nature of the play - players jump many times their own height, making slam dunks that defy both human capabilities and the laws of physics. There are no fouls, free throws, or violations except goaltending and 24-second violations. This means the player is able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, if a player makes three baskets in a row, he becomes ""on fire"" and has unlimited turbo and increased shooting precision. The ""on fire"" mode continues until the other team scores, or until the player who is ""on fire"" scores 4 additional consecutive baskets while ""on fire.""
The game is filled with easter eggs, special features and players activated by initials or button/joystick combinations. For example, pressing A five times and right five times on any Genesis controller would activate ""Super Clean Floors"". This feature would cause characters to fall if they ran too fast or changed direction too quickly. And players can enter special codes to unlock hidden players, ranging from US President Bill Clinton to Hugo the Charlotte Hornets mascot. On the arcade machine, there is also a hidden 'tank' game that allows the player to run around a 3D wireframe field. In order to access this mode, however, the player must be able to toggle the on/off switch located behind the machine. While the game was powering back on, the player holds Up and all buttons on player 1 and Down and all buttons on player 2.",1993-06-02 00:00:00.000,10,NULL,69.0000,3,80.8621,49

93976,4338,DinoPark Tycoon,"The objective in DinoPark Tycoon is the successful administration of a dinosaur park. Players start off with a $5,000 loan in the retail version, or a $20,000 loan in the school version.[1] The money is used to pay for the land, dinosaurs, fencing, food and employees necessary to run the park and pay back the loan; failure to meet loan payments results in the park's foreclosure.[1] Once the loan is paid off, players may expand the park and earn profits. If players are confused, an animated dinosaur appears and guides the players through the game.[1]

Players then visit supply stores to buy the necessary items for park maintenance. The food store provides meat for carnivores, plants for herbivores and seeds for planting. The general store provides fences for the dinosaur pens, with varying degrees of strength and price; concessions such as bathrooms, gift shops and parking lots; and advertising, which is bought per season. The employment office offers the personnel to run the park, and Dino City retails the dinosaurs for the exhibits.

As time passes, players face problems such as escaping dinosaurs, sick employees, and seasonal attendance declines. According to Atari, ""Keeping the staff paid and the dinos fed and healthy is an ongoing task that requires kids to analyze graphs and numbers and make decisions based on their assumptions. The trick is to scratch out enough profit to expand the park with capital improvements and bigger and better dinosaurs.""[1] After paying off the loan, players may choose to sell their park; if it has been successful, the player achieves an onscreen award and an entry on the top scores list.",1993-12-31 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Meanwhile, the Queen of Leazas sends a platoon called the Rance Rescue Team to the unknown land in order to help Rance.

Raichi announces that it is time to destroy Earth and eradicate the remaining Saiyans.

Soon Mr. Popo arrives at the Son household to speak with Goku and Gohan, he tells them that Dende sent him to tell them that mysterious machines have appeared all over the planet, and they are releasing gas which kills everything around it - plants, animals, and people. Goku and Gohan head off to stop the threat, first stopping at Capsule Corp to talk with Bulma and her father, but Bulma reveals that she is unable to do anything to stop the machines. Mr. Popo then tells Goku and Gohan the location of the machines: Grand Apollon, Western Desert, Bunbuku Island, and the Land of Ice. Piccolo then arrives, stating that he also wishes to help stop this menace, Goku suggests they split up and all go after one machine, and the three Z Fighters each choose an area to head to: Goku will go to Grand Apollon, Gohan will go to the Western Desert, and Piccolo will head to Bunbuku Island. However, two monsters show up (Arbee and Kinkarn) and attack the Z Fighters. Goku attacks them with a Kamehameha, but discovers that the Destron Gas is affecting him and the others, causing them to be unable to properly use their ki attacks. Goku, Gohan, and Piccolo fight the monsters in hand-to-hand combat and defeat them. The three then head to each of their chosen areas.

Goku arrives in Grand Apollon and begins searching for the location of the Destron Gas Machine. Goku goes to the nearby town and asks around if anyone knows about the machine; nobody knows anything but say that there have been strange lights in the west. Goku heads to a large rock formation in the southwest and finds a bird egg, which soon hatches, the bird flies off and Goku follows it, eventually the two arrive at a nest area. The bird tells Goku that it had heard several things while staying on the rock and that there is a machine inside it guarded by another monster, so Goku heads back to the rock, enters and finds the Destron Gas Unit and its guard Ponkarn, Goku fights and defeats Ponkarn and then destroys the Destron Gas Machine.

Gohan arrives at the Western Desert and heads to the local town in order to get information on the Destron Gas Machine; the locals tell Gohan of a pyramid to the south, so Gohan heads there but finds it is too dark to see, so he heads back to the town and is given a flashlight by a man. Gohan heads into the pyramid and finds an inscription stating that there is an even larger pyramid buried under the sand in the southeast. Gohan heads southeast and finds a large sand dune, he inspects it and eventually finds the entrance to the pyramid. Gohan travels through the pyramid and eventually finds a mummy, who requests that Gohan help it unwrap, Gohan manages to unwrap the mummy and discovers that it is in fact a young girl. The girl reveals that she discovered the Destron Gas machine but was wrapped up by the monster guarding it and left trapped in the pyramid. The girl leads Gohan to he machine, where he confronts and defeats its guardian - Jiku - and then destroys it.

Piccolo arrives at Bunbuku Island, but has no idea where to look for the machine and so heads to the nearby town, but they don't know anything so Piccolo heads to several landmarks, including Pilaf's Castle, a large rock area, a lake with a hole in the ground, and Poco Poco Volcano. Piccolo finds nothing at any location until he arrives at the lake, where he meets a pink monster called Kawazu, Piccolo threatens it into revealing the location of the Destron Gas Unit; it obliges, revealing that the machine is beneath the Poco Poco Volcano. Piccolo heads to the volcano but finds that it is too hot to enter, so he decides to head back to Capsule Corp for help from Bulma. Bulma agrees to help, but only if Piccolo helps her with destroying some walls, he does so and she gives him a capsule full of snow to use to cool down the volcano. Piccolo heads back to the volcano and uses the capsule to cool it down, he then heads down and discovers the machine and its guard, who happens to be Kawazu, who he threatened earlier. Piccolo defeats the monster and destroys the machine.

Future Trunks arrives at Capsule Corp looking for Bulma, but cannot find he, Dr. Brief tells him that she is missing but he thinks she will come back. Future Trunks heads off to look for her at Bunbuku Island; he visits each of the islands locations but cannot locate his mother. When he heads to the Eastern Coast and discovers two monsters, he asks where Bulma is and they reveal that she has been taken to an island off the coast in the east; Future Trunks fights and defeats the two monsters and then heads to the island. He finds Bulma and also his baby present counterpart held hostage by more monsters, Future Trunks prepares to fight them, and Vegeta shows up to help him, the two defeat the monsters and then the group head back to Capsule Corp.

Goku and Gohan meet in the Land of Ice, and though Piccolo has not yet arrived, they decide to head out to look for the last machine. They go to a giant control tower in the east and upon arriving are joined by Piccolo. They find the guard who reveals that the last machine is not in the tower, and that the instructions for the machine have already been sent from the tower. The group head to talk to Bulma and then return to the Land of Ice, where they are attacked by an army of monsters; they defeat the monsters and follow their leader southwest to a large rock. Vegeta and Future Trunks arrive, the group then destroy the machine, but it explodes and damages all of them; another army of the monsters (comprised of Gure, Skud, and Bude) attacks the Z Fighters but is eventually defeated. The group are then contacted by Dende, who tells them to head back to West City, as something strange is happening at the television station.

Upon arriving at West City, Bulma tells the Z Fighters that they must head straight to the television station, which is dark aside from four spotlights, revealing four figures: Frieza, Cooler, Slug, and Turles. After the Z Fighters and their past enemies finish talking, they head to a deserted area of the world to fight. First Slug and Turles battle the Z Fighters, only to be defeated, so Frieza and Cooler engage the heroes, only to also be defeated. The villains regenerate and begin the fight again, Turles and Slug attack together, and are defeated, and then Frieza and Cooler attack and are beaten. King Kai then contacts Goku and tells him how to properly defeat the evil warriors. Turles, Slug, Cooler, and Frieza all attack together again and are defeated, but before the group is able to finish them off Frieza launches a huge blast and destroys Bunbuku Island, killing all of the island's inhabitants. The Z Fighters then decide to head offto collect the Dragon Balls in order to bring back Bunbuku Island and its inhabitants, and then head to space to defeat the threat once and for all. Bulma says that to make a space ship for them, she needs some special alien crystals, but they were located on Bunbuku Island, so the Z Fighters are given the Dragon Radar by Bulma, and head off to collect the Dragon Balls.

The Z Fighters head around the world and collect four Dragon Balls, then get the fifth from Krillin, they then head back to West City and find Emperor Pilaf, Pilaf reveals the locations of his two collected Dragon Balls and the Z Fighters collect them. The Z Fighters return to Pilaf and they wish for Bunbuku Island to return, they then collect the crystals and head back to Bulma, who builds a ship for them. The Z Fighters then head to space.

The Z Fighters head to the Dark Planet, but find that it is surrounded by a force field; the ship is damaged by the shield and it crash lands on desert planet. The Z Fighters head to the nearest town and are told by the inhabitants that their elder is in a giant tower that is in the southwest. The elder says that he will help repair the ship if they collect an ancient ring for him. The ring is located in a tomb on the planet and so the group head to it, enter it and begin searching for the ring; they find it in a pyramid inside the tomb, but Frieza is guarding it. The Z Fighters fight and defeat Frieza and then take the ring. The Z Fighters give the ring to the elder, who then helps them repair the ship. The group then head into space again, and contact Bulma to tell her what has happened. The group then spot another ship and decide to follow it to see if the crew know how to get into the Dark Planet.

The Z Fighters arrive at the planet where the ship they were following has landed, it is a planet of water. After they help it, the alien in the ship gives them a device which can help them get onto the Dark Planet. The group then head back to the desert planet for information on the item and are told that it will allow them to travel beneath the sea to a hidden city. The Z Fighters then head back to the fire planet and go to the underwater city. The people there inform them that there is one who can help them get into the Dark Planet, but they were captured and taken to a whirlpool; the Z Fighters head out and save the person, who creates a special orb which can negate the barrier and gives it to them.

The Z Fighters head to the Dark Planet and infiltrate the fortress, defeating Raichi's robotic minions and then confronting Doctor Raichi himself. The Z Fighters battle and defeat Raichi, who then regenerates and attacks again, only to be finally defeated. After Raichi is defeated, his super computer Hatchiyack achieves its humanoid form and attacks the Z Fighters, who fight it, and after a long fight defeat it, finally stopping the Tuffle threat.",1993-08-06 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

A time traveller on a reconnaissance mission from the distant future became stranded in the England of the late 1800s, and his technology came into the hands of the Royal Society, led by Baron Fortesque (based upon Charles Babbage), a grand inventor. Fortesque then retro engineered many of the futuristic contraptions, creating an entirely different, alternate timeline.

Baron Fortesque then succeeded in his greatest creation yet: the Chaos Engine, which was able to experiment with matter and the very nature of space and time. Unfortunately for the rest of the proud kingdom, the Engine then proceeded to become sentient, captured and assimilated its creator, and began to change the countryside for the worse. Vile monsters and destructive automata appeared everywhere, and even prehistoric beasts were resurrected. Telegram wires connecting the British Isles to the European mainland are cut, and any ship attempting to enter a British port is attacked. The British Royal Family, members of Parliament and a large number of refugees manage to escape across the sea, bringing with them many tales of horror. The British Empire is left in tatters, and the world in economic and political chaos. That lures a number of mercenaries on a potentially-rewarding quest to infiltrate the quarantined Britain, find the root of the problem and swiftly bring a full stop to it.",1993-02-01 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Lemele (Remeer in the Japanese version), the son of Saro, was born 100 years before the beginning of the game, and became a hero when he defeated the demon Gariso. Now 100 years old, Lemele has become the benevolent and powerful ruler of the world.

The seven characters are recruited from various walks of life and corners of the globe by the elderly King Lemele. After 5 years of training at his palace, Lemele dispatches his seven apprentices in a quest for the seven runes. Each rune possesses a great power that can be used by the person who wields it.

114261,3164,Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame,"The game takes place eleven days after the events of the first game. During this period, the Prince was hailed as a hero who defeated the evil Jaffar. He turns down all riches and instead asks for the Princess's hand in marriage as his reward, to which the Sultan of Persia reluctantly agrees. The game begins as the Prince enters the royal courts of the palace. Before he enters, his appearance changes into that of a beggar. Nobody recognizes him, and when he attempts to speak with the Princess, a man who shares his appearance (Jaffar, who is magically disguised) emerges from the shadows, ordering him to be thrown out. With guards pursuing him, the Prince jumps through a window and flees the city by way of a ship. 
 
Falling asleep on the ship, the Prince dreams of a mysterious woman who asks the Prince to come to her. At this time, the ship is struck by lightning, cast by Jaffar. When the Prince regains consciousness, he finds himself on the shore of a foreign island. He comes to a cave full of reanimated human skeletons that fight him. He finally escapes on a magic carpet. In the meantime, in Persia, Jaffar seizes the throne in the guise of the prince. The Princess falls ill under Jaffar's spell of gradual death. 
 
The magic carpet takes the Prince to the ruins of an old city filled with screaming ghosts, snakes and traps. Arriving at what appears to have once been a throne room, the Prince loses consciousness and the mysterious woman, revealed to be his mother, appears again. She explains that the Prince is of a royal lineage and the only survivor of the massacre by ""armies of darkness"". She implores him to avenge the fallen. 
 
The Prince rides a magical horse to a red temple, inhabited by warrior monks wearing bird headdresses. There, he finds that the shadow, created in the events of the original game, can now leave his body at his will. He wields his shadow to obtain the magic flame of the temple, at which point the bird warriors kneel before him. He flies back to Persia on the magic horse and confronts Jaffar. With the shadow and the flame, the Prince burns Jaffar, killing him for good. 
 
With Jaffar's spell broken, the Princess awakens. The Prince orders the former Vizier's ashes to be scattered. The game ends on a cliffhanger when an old witch is shown watching the happy couple through a crystal ball. According to Jordan Mechner the plot of the old witch and the ""armies of darkness"" were set to be resolved in a sequel, which never came.",1993-12-31 00:00:00.000,10,NULL,30.0000,1,70.9329,31

Dr. Wily reveals himself and announces that he will be using the robots from the exposition to help him in his quest for world domination, using a radio wave to control the robots. Rock and Rush aren't affected due to their circuits having a strong sense of justice, but Beat loses four of his parts in the commotion. Dr. Light quickly returns to his laboratory to change Rock into the combat robot Mega Man. Meanwhile, Dr. Wily scatters the controlled robots to cause havoc in the city. Ready for battle, Mega Man must stand up against the expo's newly developed, high-performance robots and stop Dr. Wily, and if possible also find the parts Beat dropped so he can assist him.",1993-10-29 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,64.3576,11

There, he works alongside the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC), a multi-planetary conglomerate and military contractor performing secret experiments on interdimensional travel. Recently, the teleportation has shown signs of anomalies and instability, but the research continues nonetheless.

Suddenly, something goes wrong and creatures from hell swarm out of the teleportation gates on Deimos and Phobos. A defensive response from base security fails to halt the invasion, and the bases are quickly overrun by monsters; all personnel are killed or turned into zombies

A military detachment from Mars travels to Phobos to investigate the incident. The player is tasked with securing the perimeter, as the assault team and their heavy weapons are brought inside. Radio contact soon ceases and the player realizes that he is the only survivor. Being unable to pilot the shuttle off of Phobos by himself, the only way to escape is to go inside and fight through the complexes of the moon base.",1993-12-10 00:00:00.000,345,1,80.0000,4,84.4272,784

Months have passed... and the Queen's parting threat of revenge has become a distant memory to Professor T. Bird and the Battletoads - Zitz, Rash and Pimple.

However, when a mysterious energy beam from outer space renders Earth's military might powerless, and a city-sized spaceship called the Colossus smashes out of the moon, the Professor knows it has to be the Dark Queen trying her latest galaxy-dominating plan.

He's right, of course, but what he doesn't realize is that the shady lady's taking no chances this time, and she's cunningly teamed up with the equally shady Shadow Boss! This means that the Battletoads will not only have to fight the Queen and her sidekicks, General Slaughter, Big Blag and Robo Manus - but Abobo and Roper, the Shadow Boss's minions, as well!

So, that's how it stands 'toads: the Dark Queen's got herself some serious back-up and now she's comin' to take over your Earth - what're ya gonna do about it?

132163,18696,Ridge Racer,"In the PlayStation version, the player can play a mini-game of Galaxian as the game loads. If the player wins before the game loads, eight additional cars become available to drive in the game. The twelve cars are varied in their specifications, with some featuring a high top speed, others excelling at acceleration or turning, and others being more balanced. Certain cars are named after other Namco games such as Solvalou, Mappy, Bosconian, Nebulasray, and Xevious. Once the game has loaded, all the CD is needed for afterwards is to play six instrumental music tracks. The player can replace the disc at any time during gameplay, although the game does not update to reflect the switch; regardless of what disc is inserted, there will always be six tracks to choose from, corresponding the starting points of the six tracks on the game disc.
After launching the game, the player can choose a course, transmission (automatic or six-speed manual), car and song. During the race, the player can observe the racetrack from the first-person perspective (or from the third-person perspective for the PlayStation version). Namco's NeGcon controller can be used to play the game. Being an arcade racer, collisions do no damage to the car, and merely slow the player down. There is also a time limit, which ends the game if it counts down to zero. Checkpoints are present throughout the track that give the player additional time when passed through.
The game features only a single race track, although it consists of four race configurations of varying difficulty; Novice, Intermediate, Advanced and Time Trial (in the latter two, the track is extended). The player races against eleven other cars except in Time Trial, where there is only one opponent. The higher the difficulty level, the faster the cars run, with Time Trial mode featuring the fastest cars. Each race consists of three laps (two on the beginner course). In the PlayStation version, after the player wins every race, ""extra"" races become available, which are raced on a reversed version of the course, and the player encounters an additional opponent in Time Trial mode; the 13th Racing ""Devil"" car, the fastest car in the game. Upon winning this race, the car is unlocked for the player to drive. In the arcade version, after finishing the game, the winning player's score is saved in action-replay highlights.
The PlayStation version also features hidden ""mirror"" version of the tracks. The track becomes a ""mirror image"" of itself; left turns become right turns and vice-versa, and the surroundings switch sides of the road.",1993-11-30 00:00:00.000,2,NULL,82.0000,1,74.4333,16

WARNING:

""X"" IS THE FIRST OF A NEW GENERATION OF ROBOTS WHICH CONTAIN AN INNOVATIVE NEW FEATURE - THE ABILITY TO THINK, FEEL AND MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS. HOWEVER THIS ABILITY COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS. IF ""X"" WERE TO BREAK THE FIRST RULE OF ROBOTICS, ""A ROBOT MUST NEVER HARM A HUMAN BEING"", THE RESULTS WOULD BE DISASTROUS AND I FEAR THAT NO FORCE ON EARTH COULD STOP HIM.

APPROXIMATELY 30 YEARS WILL BE REQUIRED BEFORE WE CAN SAFELY CONFIRM HIS RELIABILITY. UNFORTUNATELY I WILL NOT LIVE TO SEE THAT DAY, NOR DO I HAVE ANYONE TO CARRY ON MY WORK. THEREFORE, I HAVE DECIDED TO SEAL HIM IN THIS CAPSULE, WHICH WILL TEST HIS INTERNAL SYSTEMS UNTIL HIS RELIABILITY HAS BEEN CONFIRMED. PLEASE DO NOT DISTURB THE CAPSULE UNTIL THAT TIME.

""X"" POSSESSES GREAT RISKS AS WELL AS GREAT POSSIBILITIES. I CAN ONLY HOPE FOR THE BEST.

X's design interested Cain, and he analyzed Dr. Light's notes. Months later, Cain was able to create robots similar to X, called Reploids, and they began to be mass-produced around the world. For unknown reasons, some Reploids began to act strange and attacked humans, being labeled Mavericks. To counter any possible threat, the Maverick Hunters were formed. Sigma, an advanced Reploid, was assigned to be their leader. X also became a member of the Maverick Hunters. Time passes and the Maverick Hunters are able to keep peace, but one day Sigma himself became a Maverick, being joined by other Maverick Hunters to start a war against humanity. Although X was by nature a pacifist, he had to do something, so he joined the new leader of the Maverick Hunters, Zero, to stop the ambitions of Sigma and the Mavericks.",1993-12-17 00:00:00.000,68,NULL,85.0000,1,86.4973,204

143063,84774,B.O.B.,"When B.O.B. crashes his dad's space car on the way to pick up his date, he finds himself stranded on a hostile asteroid filled with enemies. By collecting power ups and using fast reflexes, B.O.B. tries to find his way off the asteroid and to his date. B.O.B. fights his way through three strange worlds in total, encountering several particularly enormous or swift enemies (bosses) along the way, and participating in several cart-race levels. There were several different types of setting for each level, including domed space colony cities, large alien hive-type areas, strange biomechanical facilities, ancient (and apparently haunted) temples and cavernous magma chambers. Some of these settings only appeared on certain worlds.

At the end of each world, B.O.B manages to discover a new space-car to allow him to continue on his journey. The first two both fail him under comical circumstances, resulting in him becoming trapped on an entirely new alien world. With the final car, B.O.B. is at last able to meet up with his date, who is revealed to be a large, blue female robot with a huge mouth, who harshly berates B.O.B. for his tardiness. As she is yelling at him, a slender red female robot flies past them on a space surfboard. B.O.B., frustrated with his obnoxious date, declares ""That's the girl for me!"" and drives off in pursuit of the red female. The game ends with a shot of B.O.B. and his new date sitting on a small asteroid together, staring out at the beauty of the cosmos in silence. Behind them, B.O.B.'s car (in the backseat of which his date had stashed her surfboard) stalls and drifts off into space, presumably leaving them stranded together but neither of the lovers seem to notice.",1993-06-30 00:00:00.000,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Appearances can be very deceiving, however .... Beneath the peaceful tranquility of this small village, a horrifying truth lingers.

Whispers in a dusty, secluded library ripple with fear as questions of the past are brought into the present. Is there a link between the return of Halley's comet and the resurgence of the Great Ancients who once dominated the land in a reign of terror? Legend tells tales of an ancient ritual ground, hidden deep in the shadows of the tangled forest, marked by an ornate and mysterious cross. Once, long ago, this site was the stage for wild and terrifying rites that no one dare speak of, lest they suffer the wrath of the Ancients.

Why are the townspeople of Illsmouth struck by such shattering terror? Why are they drawn to the ancient ritual grounds after so many years? What has released this curse from its deep sleep to play havoc upon the souls of innocent people?

151705,91094,Battletoads / Double Dragon: The Ultimate Team,"Following her crushing defeat at the hands of the Battletoads on Ragnarok's World, the humiliated Dark Queen hightailed it to the outer reaches of the universe. Months have passed... and the Queen's parting threat of revenge has become a distant memory to Professor T. Bird and the Battletoads - Zitz, Rash and Pimple.

However, when a mysterious energy beam from outer space renders Earth's military might powerless, and a city-sized spaceship called the Colossus smashes out of the moon, the Professor knows it has to be the Dark Queen trying her latest galaxy-dominating plan.

He's right, of course, but what he doesn't realize is that the shady lady's taking no chances this time, and she's cunningly teamed up with the equally shady Shadow Boss! This means that the Battletoads will not only have to fight the Queen and her sidekicks, General Slaughter, Big Blag and Robo Manus - but Abobo and Roper, the Shadow Boss's minions, as well!

So, that's how it stands 'toads: the Dark Queen's got herself some serious back-up and now she's comin' to take over your Earth - what're ya gonna do about it? First of all you're gonna get the sides EVEN! Those terrific twins, Billy and Jimmy Lee, otherwise known as the Double Dragon, are just rarin' to get in on the action, 'specially since the Shadow Boss is their archest of enemies!",1993-12-01 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,71.0000,2

Godzilla is led to Osaka, where he fights and kills King Ghidorah. Immediately afterwards, Ghidorah's body vanishes and an alien spaceship appears. The invaders reveal that they were controlling Ghidorah, and demand that the human race surrender. Meanwhile, another Godzilla appears in Mt. Fuji, and the Super X II lures the real Godzilla there to fight it. Godzilla confronts the new Godzilla, who is revealed to be Mechagodzilla wearing an artificial skin. During Godzilla's fight with the robot, the aliens kidnap Dr. Shiragami and take him to Lake Ashino. Godzilla goes there to rescue the professor, and is confronted by Biollante, his plant-like clone. After defeating Biollante, the Super X II rescues Shiragami, it is revealed that the doctor had recovered DNA samples of Godzilla and King Ghidorah and had been experimenting on them to create a serum that enhances the physical attributes of any being. However, the aliens invaded his laboratory and stole the samples, using them to create Biollante.

Dr. Shiragami injects some of the serum into Godzilla, making him stronger. The aliens unleash Battra in Yokohama, and it lays an egg that is threatening to hatch. Godzilla travels to Yokohama, kills Battra, and destroys the egg before it can hatch. King Ghidorah soon returns as Mecha-King Ghidorah, having been resurrected by the aliens, and begins to attack Yokohama. The aliens reveal that they have hidden several capsules around the city that are holding Shiragami's serum. If Godzilla can find them all before Mecha-King Ghidorah destroys fifty percent of the city, he will mutate into a more powerful form. He succeeds, and confronts Mecha-King Ghidorah. The cyborg monster is easily outmatched by Godzilla's newfound power and is destroyed. However, the battle is far from over. The aliens travel to China, where they awaken an ancient creature called Bagan and inject him with sample of the serum, making him just as powerful as Godzilla. The two titans battle in the ruins of Yokohama, and Bagan proves to be more challenging than all the other monsters he faced. Eventually, Godzilla bests Bagan, and the aliens retreat, but not before promising revenge. The serum eventually wears off, and Godzilla returns to his original form. The Super X II disables the transmitter, releasing Godzilla from their control, and the mutant dinosaur returns to the ocean with humanity indebted to him for his aide.",1993-12-23 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,56.2637,5

The versus mode is played by two players simultaneously on a split screen. It's round based and to win the round the player has to prevent the aliens from landing or clear all aliens. When winning a round the player is awarded with a medal and the first player with three medals wins the game. The versus mode has less aliens and only one barricade and some of the aliens are coloured. Shooting coloured aliens trigger certain actions which can be both positive and negative. This include clearing a whole line of invaders or having the aliens jump closer to the player or his opponent.

165796,9766,Rocket Knight Adventures,"The first King El Zebulos repelled some invaders in a powerful ship called the Pig Star and was made ruler of the land. Knowing the Pig Star had the power to destroy entire worlds, El Zebulos had it placed under a magic seal for safekeeping. The ""Key to the Seal"" would be guarded and passed down by El Zebulos, and his Royal Family. Generations into the future, the kingdom has been subject to attack by neighboring countries which wanted control of The Pig Star. To protect the kingdom of Zebulos, an elite group of warriors known as the Rocket Knights were formed. These Warriors wore armor with Rocket Packs, wielded mystical swords, and harnessed awesome combat skills. 
 
Around this time, an orphan named Sparkster was taken in by Mifune Sanjulo; a friend of the King, and current leader of the Rocket Knights. Sparkster was trained to become a Rocket Knight at an early age. Later on, a corrupt Rocket Knight by the name of Axel Gear fought and wounded Mifune as he tried to steal an ancient book, which contained the secrets of the rocket knights. Sparkster was appointed the new Rocket Knight leader and spent 10 years posing as an outlaw as he searched for Axel Gear, only to return to Zebulos and hear rumors about Axel Gear's return. 
 
By now the Kingdom is under attack by the Devotindos Empire led by Emperor Devligus Devotindos; who is said to have the power of hypnosis. Sparkster finds that Axel Gear has kidnapped Princess Sherry in attempt to blackmail the king into surrendering The ""Key to the Seal"". However it just so happens that the Princess is the only one who knows of its location. Sparkster rushes through jungles, caves, and even into Devotindos territory to save the princess.",1993-08-05 00:00:00.000,14,NULL,NULL,NULL,79.0429,33

166069,8804,SimFarm,"Mirroring duties on a real farm, SimFarm puts players in charge of building up the land, placing the buildings, buying and selling livestock and planting crops. A weather and season system are in place as well, presenting the same kind of challenges found in a real-world farm. As with SimCity, there are disasters that can wreak havoc on the player's farm. Tornadoes, droughts, pests, and dust storms are some of the events that can disrupt farm crops and harvests. 
 
SimFarm also has a small town included in its simulation. This town is reminiscent of SimCity in its form and function. The player may interact with the town occasionally by suggesting new tile types and joining competitions with livestock (such as sending in a prize pig to potentially earn a blue ribbon and a cash prize.) Suggesting an airport to be built in the town will usually cause its construction, thus unlocking the ability to buy and use a crop duster. 
 
The homestead in SimFarm is where the player lives and is expanded at the beginning of each game year if the player has made enough money in the previous year.",1993-12-31 00:00:00.000,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,79.9891,10

166093,1028,The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening,"After the events of A Link to the Past, the hero Link travels by ship to other countries to train for further threats. A storm destroys his boat at sea, and he washes ashore on Koholint Island where he is taken to the house of Tarin by his daughter Marin. She is fascinated by Link and the outside world, and tells Link wishfully that, if she were a seagull, she would leave and travel across the sea. After Link recovers his sword, a mysterious owl tells him that he must wake the Wind Fish, Koholint's guardian, in order to return home. The Wind Fish lies dreaming in a giant egg on top of Mt. Tamaranch, and can only be awakened by the eight Instruments of the Sirens.

Link proceeds to explore a series of dungeons in order to recover the eight instruments. During his search for the sixth instrument, Link goes to the Ancient Ruins. There he finds a mural that details the reality of the island: that it is merely a dream world created by the Wind Fish. After this revelation, the owl tells Link that this is only a rumor, and only the Wind Fish knows for certain whether it is true. Throughout Koholint Island, nightmare creatures attempt to obstruct Link's quest for the instruments, as they wish to rule the Wind Fish's dreamworld.

After collecting all eight instruments from the eight dungeons across Koholint, Link climbs to the top of Mt. Tamaranch and plays the Ballad of the Wind Fish. This breaks open the egg in which the Wind Fish sleeps; Link enters and confronts the last evil being, a Nightmare that takes the form of Ganon and other enemies from Link's past.[24] Its final transformation is ""DethI"", a cyclopean, dual-tentacled Shadow. After Link defeats DethI, the owl reveals itself to be the Wind Fish's spirit, and the Wind Fish confirms that Koholint is all his dream. When Link plays the Ballad of the Wind Fish again, he and the Wind Fish awaken; Koholint Island and all its inhabitants slowly disappear. Link finds himself lying on his ship's driftwood in the middle of the ocean, with the Wind Fish flying overhead. If the player did not lose any lives during the game, Marin is shown flying after the ending credits finish.",1993-06-06 00:00:00.000,66,NULL,80.0000,0,85.9132,156

Set in a different universe from the original Mazinger story, the story begins in the year 1999 AD, when God Kaiser Hell began an all-out invasion to control Earth using powerful giants known as 'Bio Beasts'. Mazinger Z in Mazin Saga is actually a suit of armor rather than a robot. This armor has the ability to transform into a giant version of itself, allowing Mazinger Z to battle the Bio Beasts.

Mazinger Z's design in Mazin Saga is a departure from the rest of the Mazingers. Here, Mazinger Z is given an all-blue color rather than black in white like the others. Colored orbs are mounted on Mazinger Z's crown and torso. In many instances, Mazinger Z dons a red cape and its only weapon in combat is a sword, similar to God Mazinger.

The characters from the original Mazinger Z series reprise their roles in Mazin Saga, albeit slightly different from their anime/manga counterparts. Dr. Hell appears in Mazin Saga as God Kaiser Hell. Koji Kabuto still plays the protagonist, but has as darker, more serious persona than featured in the anime and manga versions of Mazinger Z. Even Garada K7, one of the earliest enemies Mazinger Z fought in the original series, reappears as a Bio Beast.",1993-02-25 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,77.8417,5
